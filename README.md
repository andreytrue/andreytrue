### Hi 👋, my name is Andrey Demyanov.

I'm 27 years old and specializing on FrontEnd (React / Typescript).

## Technologies

* I'm writing on React + TypeScript;
* For state control I use Redux (frequently);
* I know how to make styles semantically, adaptively and cross-browser;
* For styling can use pure CSS, SCSS/LESS, MaterialUI (MUI);
* I am interested in algorithms, speeding up work and improving the quality of the code;
